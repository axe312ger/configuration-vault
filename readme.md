# Configuration Vault

> This repo is intended to store all config that contains
> all basics for a proper web developer workstation.


## Installation

1. Clone this repo somewhere on your machine
2. Run `setup-brew.sh` which installs all basic software
3. (optional) run any other `setup-*.sh` file to set up the other stuff

This is **not** intended to overwrite any dot files in your home directory.
When attaching an import statement to your original config file is not possible,
it is renamed and replaced with a symlink into this repo.

So storing and version controlling all your system config should no be a
big hussle anymore.
