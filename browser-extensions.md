# (Chrome) browser extensions

Users of other browsers might easily find alternatives. If possible, I linked the project page with the install button for all browsers instead of the Chrome Web Store links.

## Essentials
Surfing without these is simply not a good idea

### [Adblock](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/adblock/gighmmpiobklfepjocnamgkkbiglidom)

> Saves bandwith, saves loading time, protects you from virus attacks and makes sure, your eye's won't hurt of big black dongs or flickering raindbow adds. Ohh, also, this one is able to hide Youtube Ads!!!

### [Keep my Pinned Tab](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/keep-my-pinned-tab/dcebfccimkdnjbkibdmidghomhcodilp)

> Pinned tabs should not just disappear! This saved me so often from accidently closing soundcloud.

### [Empty New Tab Page](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/empty-new-tab-page/dpjamkmjmigaoobjbekmfgabipmfilij)

> For minimalists, also hides the most visited websites.

### [Smart QrCode Generator](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/smart-qrcode-generator/nfnbjbobhhoaekejilcmdkfomkndikho)

> Best think with this QrCode Generator is: It lives within the url bar, so you won't get another extension button which polutes your screen. Why do you need it? Sharing urls to your mobile was never that easy!!

## Communication
Isn't that the reason, most of us use this fancy thing called internet?

### [Cryptocat](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cryptocat/gonbigodpnfghidmnphnadhepmbabhij)

> **Very** secure chatting browser extension. Uses the [OTR cryptographic protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-the-Record_Messaging) which is one of the strongest text encryption methods we know so far. Also available for other platforms. Get more details at the [cryptocat website](https://crypto.cat/).

### [Appear.in Screen Sharing](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/appearin-screen-sharing/bodncoafpihbhpfljcaofnebjkaiaiga)

> If you don't know [appear.in](htts://appear.in): This is an awesome alternative to Skype, Google Hangout etc. No account needed, just share the link with your partner and start video chatting.

## Dev tools & apps

### [JSON Formatter](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/json-formatter/bcjindcccaagfpapjjmafapmmgkkhgoa?hl=en)
> Never ever unreadable JSON in your browser again.

### [Advanced REST client](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/advanced-rest-client/hgmloofddffdnphfgcellkdfbfbjeloo)

### [Postman](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman/fhbjgbiflinjbdggehcddcbncdddomop)

### [Redux DevTools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd)

## Privacy & rights

### [Terms of Service? Didn't Read!](https://tosdr.org/)
> “I have read and agree to the Terms” is the biggest lie on the web. This addon tries to fix it by giving you an overview and a rating for the ToS of the current website.

### [HTTPS Everywhere](https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere)
> Simply tries to use encrypted connections to websites when it is possible.


### [Location Guard](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/location-guard/cfohepagpmnodfdmjliccbbigdkfcgia)
> Location tracking can be nice, this extension helps you to reveal not to detailed position data. Not every websites needs to know where *exactly* you life.

### [Citizen Ex](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/citizen-ex/jjfgpjihgigboplilbcehdbacklfgjlp)
> See in which locations you are actually surfing. Pretty interesting.
